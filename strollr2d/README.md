Description:
-----

STROLLR is an image denoising framework based on a joint adaptive patch sparse and group low-rank model learning scheme (STROLLR). The proposed scheme is capable of better representing natural images by exploiting both its local sparsity and non-local similarity. Our numerical experiments show promising performance for the proposed image denoising method compared to popular prior or state-of-the-art methods.
